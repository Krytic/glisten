# Contributing to Glisten

Glisten is an open-source project released under the [MIT License](LICENSE). That means contributions are welcome, so long as they follow a few simple guidelines:

## Direct code contributions
### Issues

When making an issue, please detail what you are trying to do (intended behaviour), what you are getting (main issue), and what you expect to see (expected output). Be explicit and where possible provide steps to reproduce the issue. Even better is to link your code either in another GitHub repo or on [Hastebin](https://hastebin.com) or similar.

If you're commenting on an issue, please:
- Be respectful!
- Remember, not everybody possesses the same knowledge as you. Don't overcomplicate things, and if someone asks you to explain something, don't brush them off. **Just do it.**

### Pull Requests

Please do not work directly on master. This is a bad habit of mine, and something I'm actively trying to shake. Master should be for stable code, but not necessarily feature-complete versions of the whole code. For instance:

- If you are working on a bugfix, please do so on a **dedicated branch**.
- If you are working on a feature, please do so on a **dedicated branch**.
- If your feature is complete, please **open a pull request into master**.

If you include a new feature, please please please *write some docs about it!*
